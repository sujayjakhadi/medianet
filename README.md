## (Live) Stocks App

## Libraries / Frameworks Used:
React<br>
Ant Design<br>
ReCharts<br>
react-websocket<br>

## Build Information

This app has been published on https://sujayjakhadi.github.io/medianet/. But since the websocket url is not secured, the connection can not be established via https. As github pages enforces https, a secured socket will be required for a successful connection.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
